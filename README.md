# WoZ-Way Hello World

This project contains sample code for getting started sending messages back and
forth to the car using a wizard control interface.

## Software Requirements
### Car
1. An Apple computer running macOS (required for use with Apple text to speech system)

2. NodeJS 4+

### Control
1. A server with NodeJS 4+ and avialble port open (default port is 8000)

2. A computer with a modern web-browser

### Message Broker
WoZ Way used MQTT, a popular publish/subscribe messaging protocol to communicate messages between the car and the control interface. This is done so that only the MQTT broker IP needs to be known. I use a popular and free MQTT broker called Mosquitto [https://mosquitto.org]. You can set up Mosquitto on a Unix based server fairly easily.

## Instructions
1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed on both the CAR computer and the CONTROL server. If you are on a Mac and
use Homebrew [https://brew.sh], you can use `brew install node`

2. Navigate to the **CONTROL** directory and run `npm install`

3. In the **CONTROL** directory, run `node server.js`

4. Navigate to the **CAR** directory and run `npm install`

5. In the **CAR** directory, run `node server.js`

6. In a web browser, navigate to `localhost:8000` - this is where the control
interface is. You should be able to see live data coming back from the car. You
should also be able to send messages using the message input for custom messages
of from the Common Questions area by clicking the buttons.

7. (Additional) If you can serve the control interface from a known server with a public IP, then you can navigate to `<your.server.ip>:8000`

### MQTT Setup
The sample code provided points to an MQTT broker running on the same machine where the control service is running.  We recommend setting up Mosquitto using the Instructions provided at [https://mosquitto.org].

### Changing Voices on macOS

You can set the default voice in your System Preferences -> Accessibilty -> Speech. I recommend you use voice with High Quality options.

The system will work with any language provided by Apple. Just choose a voice for your prefered langueage, for example Kyoko for Japanese, and then send messages in Japanese from the wizard control interface.
